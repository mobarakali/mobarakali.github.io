<h2>1. What is the Feasibility Study of the SDLC model & why is this important?</h2>

<b>Ans:</b> A feasibility study means the first phase of a prospective project to estimate the practicality of a suggested plan or method. As per regarding the SDLC  - Software Development Life Cycle, Feasibility Study is also the very First Step of it. Thus Feasibility Study is so important that we can not even Start Software development without thinking about it. 

This step helps to determine whether the project is worth pursuing and whether the goals and objectives of the project can be achieved within the specified discretions. It is important because it helps to prevent wasting resources on projects that are unlikely to be successful, and it helps to identify and mitigate potential risks early in the development process.

<h2>2. Write 5 advantages of Agile methodology.</h2>

<b>Ans:</b>  Agile methodology has many advantages, here are just 5 of them:
    <ol>
    <li> Requirement Changing Opportunity </li>
    <li> Software quality increase/improvement </li>
    <li> Can assess overall Software Development Progress </li>
    <li> CI/CD: Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment is achievable here.</li>
    <li> Multiple Teams can work together.</li>
    </ol>

<h2>3. Write short notes on SDLC model phase.</h2>

<b>Ans:</b> Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC) is a model that represents all the methods required to make a Software product transit through it's life cycle stages.
We can detereminbe the followitn steps of SDLC:
<ul>
<li>Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis (Feasibility Study)</li>
<li>Stage 2: Defining Requirements</li>
<li>Stage 3: Designing the Software</li>
<li>Stage 4: Building or Developing the Software</li>
<li>Stage 5: Testing the Software</li>
<li>Stage 6: Deployment and Maintenance</li>
</ul>
